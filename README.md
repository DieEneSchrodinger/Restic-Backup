# Restic-Backup
A small restic container that uses scripts to make backups.<br>
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dieeneschrodinger/restic-backup)

Currently, version tagging is done by using the version tag of the alpine base, this will soon be updated once semi active development starts

## Planned Features:
- Email notifications
- Config file and ENV variables rather than using a bash script
- Make the container Read-Only
